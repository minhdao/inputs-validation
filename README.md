# Some thoughts :)

Inputs validation should be done on both frontend and backend sides.

Frontend validation enhances the user experience whereas backend validation ensures the final desired format for inputs.

Frontend validation is normally done with Javascript and lots of the time through other Javascript libraries. HTML5 also provides good support along the way.

When it comes to backend side it depends on the language used over there. However, if you are using NodeJS for the backend, then front and back speak the same language.

This allows code reuse if you can separate the rules and write it in a way that both frontend and backend can call.
